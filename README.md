# ImageClassification_UsingTensorflowJS
Image Classification Using Tensorflow.js

## Application Description:

In this project we build a UI for Image Classification using PreTrainedModel MobileNet. We are using Tensorflow.js library to load a model and make prediction using javascript programming. When a user uploads an image in the website the image is transformed into a tensor and we pass that image into the model to make predictions. 

The output will be Predicted class Name and its probability.
